# SEO? Fuck off!

Question: Is content _really_ google's ranking factor number one? Or is technical on- and off-page SEO more important?

I deliberately don't use any pictures here. (yeah, no fucking alt-text, I know, we read the same technical shit about "truly important on-page SEO", fuck off!)

No link-building, no backlinking, no blackhat crap. No PBN. Just text.

Bummer: I don't use a SEO optimized wordpress theme. I don't use an all in one SEO plugin, no Yoast SEO plugin. No wordpress at all. Wordpress is overkill for 90% of websites. Fuck off, wordpress!

I don't sell crap here. No course, no fucking 7$ e-book, no fucking e-mail list, not even a fucking "free give-away".

This isn't much text. My rant is just 203 words.

Now, let's see how well this page will rank for "Fuck off SEO".
